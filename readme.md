To handle streaming in your service, instead of generating a pre-signed URL for S3, you'll have your Node.js service directly download the image from S3 and **stream** it back to the mobile app in chunks. This is ideal for a streaming app where large files (e.g., images or videos) are served, optimizing performance and reducing memory usage.

### Steps:

1. **Update the Node.js Service**:
   - Instead of returning a pre-signed URL, the service will download the image from S3 and stream it back to the mobile app.
   - The `s3.getObject` method from AWS SDK will be used to fetch the object and stream it to the client.

2. **React Native Component**:
   - The mobile app will still make a request to the service, but this time it will receive the actual image data, which can be rendered in the app.

### Updated Node.js Service with Streaming:

Here is the updated service that streams the image directly from the S3 bucket.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

// Initialize AWS SDK with S3 credentials
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION
});

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Route to fetch and stream the image from S3
app.get('/image/:key', (req, res) => {
  const { key } = req.params;
  const bucketName = process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME;

  const params = {
    Bucket: bucketName,
    Key: key, // This is the image filename in the bucket
  };

  // Get the image from S3 and stream it back to the client
  const stream = s3.getObject(params).createReadStream();

  // Handle any errors with the stream
  stream.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Error streaming image from S3:', err);
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching image from S3');
  });

  // Pipe the image stream directly to the response (streaming)
  stream.pipe(res);
});

// Start the Express server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **`s3.getObject().createReadStream()`**:
   - Instead of loading the whole image into memory, we stream the image in chunks directly from S3 to the client using `createReadStream`.
   - This minimizes memory usage and ensures that the client starts receiving the image data as soon as the stream begins, making it ideal for large files.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - We handle any errors that might occur while streaming (e.g., the object doesn't exist in S3 or a network issue).
   
3. **Streaming Response**:
   - The image is streamed directly to the client (the mobile app) through the `stream.pipe(res)` call. This method sends the image data as chunks, improving load times for large files.

### Updated React Native Code:

In your React Native app, you would make a network request to the Node.js service and display the streamed image.

Since React Native's `Image` component doesn’t support directly streaming the image, you can use `react-native-fs` or similar libraries to handle streamed content and save the image temporarily on the device, then display it.

Here’s an example using `react-native-fs` to handle the streamed image:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Image, ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import RNFS from 'react-native-fs';
import axios from 'axios';

const CustomFastImage = ({ style, source, resizeMode }) => {
  const [localPath, setLocalPath] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [loadErr, setLoadErr] = useState(false);

  const serviceUrl = 'https://your-node-service-url.com/image'; // Replace with your actual Node.js service URL

  const downloadImage = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios({
        url: `${serviceUrl}/${source.uri}`,
        method: 'GET',
        responseType: 'stream',
      });

      // Create a local path to save the file
      const path = `${RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath}/${source.uri}`;
      const fileStream = RNFS.writeFile(path, response.data, 'base64');

      fileStream
        .then(() => {
          setLocalPath(path);
          setLoading(false);
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          console.error('Error writing image file:', err);
          setLoadErr(true);
          setLoading(false);
        });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error downloading image:', error);
      setLoadErr(true);
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    downloadImage();
  }, [source.uri]);

  return (
    <View>
      {!loading && localPath && !loadErr ? (
        <Image
          source={{ uri: `file://${localPath}` }}
          style={style}
          resizeMode={resizeMode}
        />
      ) : (
        <View style={[styles.loadingContainer, style]}>
          {loadErr ? (
            <Image
              style={style}
              resizeMode={resizeMode}
              source={require('../../assets/images/default.png')} // Fallback error image
            />
          ) : (
            <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#0000ff" />
          )}
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  loadingContainer: {
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});

export default CustomFastImage;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Downloading the Image**:
   - We make a request to the Node.js service to fetch the image stream using `axios`.
   - The response is a stream that is downloaded and saved to a local file using `react-native-fs`.

2. **Saving the Image**:
   - The image is saved to the device’s document directory with `RNFS.writeFile` in base64 format, which is converted back into an image.

3. **Rendering the Image**:
   - After the image is downloaded, it is displayed using the `Image` component, with the local file path passed in as the `uri`.

4. **Handling Errors**:
   - If the download or file saving process fails, a fallback image is displayed, and an error is logged.

### Improvements:

- **Cache Management**: Implement a way to manage and clear cached images to avoid excessive storage use.
- **Streaming Optimization**: For large files or media, consider chunking the stream on the server-side to improve performance further.

By implementing this approach, your service can efficiently stream images from the S3 bucket, while the React Native app can display those images after downloading them in a streaming fashion. This solution scales well for large media files, typical in streaming applications.
